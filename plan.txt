Okay so what do I all need to create?

An app where a user can create a "one-to-all" text post.

1: Post dialog box
2: List of all posts

Do I *really* need a db? I don't know tbh, I think probably.

- Relational or nah?
- I think yes relational? The DB posting and fetching is going to be the most frustrating part of this for me
-- I am not great at db's yet. This is one of my biggest weaknesses. This will be a good project to fix that.

Timeline:
End of the week of 11/17 -> Basic UI built, db chosen and orm maybe?
End of the week 11/25 -> db fully sorted, Posting and fetching post data 100% done
End of the week 11/2 -> app done.
